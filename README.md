# NewerTanooki
A NewerSMBW Save Editor.

Inspired by [Tanooki Save Editor](https://gbatemp.net/threads/tanooki-nsmbwii-level-editor.191261/) made by [Vash](https://game-hackers.com/members/4-Vash) and [Virus](https://game-hackers.com/members/1-Virus).

Credits to [Grop](https://github.com/TheGrop) for reverse engineering the ComputeChecksum function from the game for me.

Credits to [Treeki](https://github.com/Treeki) for reverse engineering save files in [NewerSMBW's game.h file](https://github.com/Treeki/NewerSMBW/blob/no-translations/Kamek/include/game.h#L222).

Credits to [Cyotek](https://github.com/cyotek) for his awesome [Windows Forms Color Picker](https://github.com/cyotek/Cyotek.Windows.Forms.ColorPicker).

# Usage
Build the code by yourself using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or download the latest [Compiled Binary](https://github.com/RedStoneMatt/NewerTanooki/releases) and open the software.

Now, click File -> Open and select the .sav file of your game.

You can now edit the save file using the different buttons, textboxes and numeric boxes.

When you're done, click File -> Save or File -> Save As... to save your new .sav file.

# Warning
I know, the code looks like a mess, it can crash sometimes during the save, or output broken data. I'm trying to fix it, but don't be too impatient.
